# Introduction

A collaborative environment for devs and designers.

❗**Storybook v6.5 still has minor issues when working with React 18**❗ (ie. transition from ReactDom.render to ReactDom.createRoot). You may ignore the warnings for now.

## Stubbing External Data

Refer to this **[link](https://storybook-addon-mock.vercel.app/?path=/story/docs-installation--page)**.

## Styling with a Single CSS File

Add the following line to the `storybook/preview-head.html` after placing the CSS file in `{projectRoot}/public` directory.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/{someCss.css}" />
```

## Design Systems

Storybook supports a lot of the features that a designer may use on a day-to-day basis out of the box.
Refer to the official documentation.
